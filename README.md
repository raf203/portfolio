# Challange:

## The challenge's task is to fulfill the following demand demand:

"AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position"

## For this, the following actions were taken:

A Portfolio with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
When click one of the links in the navigation, the UI scrolls to the corresponding section.
When click on the link to the section about their work, the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications.
The developer's first application should be larger in size than the others.
Click on the images of the applications and take to that deployed application.
Responsive layout.
